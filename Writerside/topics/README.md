## 🎯 Vision

Deploy a new SaaS app project with one command via the Developer CLI, adding application-specific features while
fundamental components are preconfigured. Complete deployment within 30 minutes.

## 🌲 Purpose

The purpose is to deploy SaaS products for personal and business use, achieve financial freedom, and escape corporate
constraints.

## 📈 Objectives

- Fun to work with and develop
- Consolidated shared infrastructure
- Cost-effective, secure, and fast deployment
- Familiar tech stack (maximize C# usage)
- Automated processes for CI/CD, disaster recovery, and documentation
- Support for multiple environments: Dev, QA, staging, and production
