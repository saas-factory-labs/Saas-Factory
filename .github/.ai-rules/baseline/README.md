# Baseline

When working with baseline features that apply to both B2C and B2B, follow these rules very carefully.

## Baseline Rules Files

- **[Clean Architecture Dependencies](./clean-architecture-dependencies.md) - CRITICAL: Strict dependency flow rules for layered architecture.**
- [Entity Modeling](./entity-modeling.md) - DDD patterns for aggregates, entities, and value objects.
- [Code Style](./code-style.md) - C# coding standards and conventions.
